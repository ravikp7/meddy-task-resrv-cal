This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It should be used with this server https://github.com/ravikp7/reservation-calendar with the updated `/reserve` api to change reservation. It has been updated to take an array of reservation objects instead of a single object.
